Future ready talent Internship project :-
This is My First Education Website I tried my level best to manage the Scalability.

Industry:
Ed-tech

Project Title:
SharpStudy

Problem Statement/Opportunity*:
The COVID-19 pandemic is causing more than 1.6 billion children and youth to be out of school in 161 countries .Education Website helps every student improve their skills , knowledge .This website for every student they are in first standard or even they are gratuate or undergratuate .Providing access to quality education and expanding learning opportunities for the students of the underserved communities in both rural and urban areas continues to be a major challenge.In the past, students had to adapt to the teaching styles of their teachers but now there is a need for the education system to modify its delivery process to suit the learning styles of the students.There is a severe shortage of qualified teachers in many schools in India. Also, teacher absenteeism in schools is a major issue. On the teachers’ front, as much as the other nonteaching duties come in the way of good preparation, lack of subject expertise and teaching resources and over-crowded classes are few of the reasons that limit the teachers to a delivery mode of lessons, rather than engaging children in partnership for learning.This platform is completely free form every student.Student can easily interact with teacher ask their doubt.The digital content has to be supplemented with proper experiential learning such as relevant hands on activities, experiments, internet activities, discussions and real time assessments.Strong critical thinking is often grounded in the questions we ask. By deliberately teaching questioning skills, we will be facilitating a process that will help students develop a mental muscle necessary for deeper learning, creativity and innovation, analysis, and problem solving. Gaming may help kids learn a variety of leadership skills, such as resource allocation,negotiating with friends and adversaries, manipulating situations and environments, actively pursuing their goals, and recovering from failures.

Project Description*:
Opportunity: What are the opportunities created by education ?
This project helps all students develop the knowledge and skills they need to be engaged and become productive members of society.In this website student can easily connect with teacher ask their doubt .Teachers can provide lessons to students more efficiently through online learning. Teachers can employ a variety of online learning tools, such as videos, PDFs, and podcasts, as part of their lesson preparations. Teachers can become more efficient educators by expanding their lesson plans beyond standard textbooks to include online resources.In this website all the information that you will need will be safely stored in an online database. This includes things like live discussion documents, training materials. This means that if there's ever anything that needs to be clarified, the student will be able to access these documents fast, saving valuable time.This website also provides students with the chance to network with peers across nations or even different continents. This often leads to other opportunities in terms of collaboration with other individuals in the implementation of a project. At the same time, it makes them culturally sensitive and able to fit into other environments easily given their exposure to other cultures.An online college education might give students access to specialized degree courses that may not be available in an easily accessible or local institution of learning. Online classes allow the sharing of expertise that helps more people have access to education that is not readily available in certain geographic locations.I will aslo add free'webinar section' for student for their future guide.Specially for rural student donot know about many opportunity this help each and every student for their future guidance and choose their correct career path.Benefits of My project is 1.Flexibility 2.Networking Opportunities 3.Reduce Student Time  4.Reduced Costs 5. Access to Expertise 5. Documentation 6.Enjoy Simplicity and Comfort and save money 7.live chat and 24/7 support team. 


And Hope you guys Love it.
Thank you all !!
